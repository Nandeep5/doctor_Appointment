# Problem Statement:
In contemporary hospital environments, the management of doctor appointments has become increasingly complex, requiring efficient administration to handle patient bookings, generate reports for cashiering purposes, and maintain crucial patient records. However, existing Record Management Systems frequently result in the misplacement of patient details and doctors' reports, leading to security vulnerabilities and disruptions in hospital operations. This research project aims to address these challenges by implementing a comprehensive computerized system to manage patient, hospital, and doctor records. Through thorough system analysis and investigation, including the use of document and data flow diagrams, data has been collected and analyzed to understand the shortcomings of the current system. The implementation of computerized report generation eliminates delays in producing reports, enhancing the efficiency of hospital operations and improving overall patient care.
# Project Description:
Doctor Appointment Booking System in hospitals today has necessitated a competent administration when handling patients, generating their reports for cashier, and patient details which serves as a key factor for the flow of business transactions in hospitals. Unfortunately the current Record Management System leads to misplacement of Patient details and doctors' record of reports and consequent upon the insecurity to these records. This research project is aimed at computerizing all the records about patients, hospitals and doctors. In order to achieve this goal, a thorough System Study and investigation was carried out and data was collected and analyzed about the current system using document and data flow diagrams. The concept of report production has been computerized hence, no more delay in report generation in the hospital about patients and their doctors.
