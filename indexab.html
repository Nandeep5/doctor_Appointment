        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Doctor Appointment Booking System in hospitals today has necessitated a competent administration when handling patients, generating their reports for cashier, and patient details which serves as a key factor for the flow of business transactions in hospitals. Unfortunately the current Record Management System leads to misplacement of Patient details and doctors' record of reports and consequent upon the insecurity to these records. This research project is aimed at computerizing all the records about patients, hospitals and doctors. In order to achieve this goal, a thorough System Study and investigation was carried out and data was collected and analyzed about the current system using document and data flow diagrams. The concept of report production has been computerized hence, no more delay in report generation in the hospital about patients and their doctors.<br></p>
       <p> Doctor Appointment Booking System (DABS) is web-based doctor appointment booking application. Our application is beneficial for consultants. Aim of this project is to create doctor patient handling management system that will help doctors in their work and will also help patients to book doctor appointments and view medical progress. The system allows doctors to manage their booking slots online. Patients are allowed to book empty slots online and those slots are reserved in their name. The system manages the appointment data for multiple doctors of various date and times. Each time a user visits a doctor his/her medical entry is stored in the database by doctor. Next time a user logs in he may view his/her entire medical history as and when needed. At the same time a doctor may view patient's previews medical history while the patient visits him. The system also consists of Blood donor module. This module allows for Blood donation registration as well as Blood group search. The module is designed to help urgent Blood requirements through easy/instant searches.
